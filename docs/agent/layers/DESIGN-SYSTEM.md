# Design system

`app/src/renderer/design-system/primitives/` is the **only** place renderer UI components should live. The old `app/src/renderer/components/ui/` tree has been fully migrated and removed except for two intentional holdouts (see below) — never add a new component there.

## Before you build new UI

1. Check the lookup table below for an existing primitive.
2. **Read the primitive's `.stories.tsx` file**, not this doc, for canonical usage and prop shapes — stories are kept in sync with the component because they're exercised by Storybook + `jest-axe`; prose here would drift. Each story is written with a short "when to use this variant" comment.
3. If nothing fits, build a new primitive under `design-system/primitives/<Name>/` following the pattern in [Adding a new primitive](#adding-a-new-primitive) below.

## Component lookup

| Need | Primitive |
|------|-----------|
| Buttons (any kind), button-styled link | `Button`, `ButtonLink` (`primitives/Button/`) |
| Bordered panel | `Card` |
| Status pill | `Badge` |
| Form text input | `Input` |
| Labeled form row (label + control + optional hint) | `Field` — use `Checkbox` directly for boolean rows; `Field`'s legacy `checkbox` layout prop is deprecated |
| Labeled boolean checkbox (settings rows, filters) | `Checkbox` — use for labeled on/off rows; `Switch` fits compact immediate toggles without a separate label row (Live auto-open kept Checkbox for legacy parity) |
| Dropdown / listbox | `Select` |
| Numeric input with stepping | `NumberField` |
| Single-value slider | `Slider` |
| Dual-thumb range slider | `RangeSlider` |
| Inline entity link (icon + label + optional peek) | `EntityLink` |
| Anchored popup panel | `Popover` |
| Modal dialog | `Dialog` (+ `DialogTitle`/`DialogClose` from `DialogParts`) |
| Collapsible section | `Accordion` |
| Hover/focus info bubble | `Tooltip` |
| Boolean on/off toggle | `Switch` |
| Tabbed panels (main app tab bar + in-tab panel groups) | `Tabs` (+ `TabsList`/`TabsTab`/`TabsPanel` from `TabsParts`; `TabsList` accepts optional `indicatorClassName` to override the default 200ms underline slide) |
| Gold-accent inline callout | `HintBanner` |
| Linear fill bar with label | `ProgressBar` |
| Pill-shaped capacity/cooldown bar | `CapacityBar` |
| Bordered list with zebra-striped rows | `DataList` / `DataListRow` |
| Small fixed-height scrollable table with a column-labeled header (Live tab history logs) | `DataTable` / `DataTableRow` — real `<table>` so header/row columns are guaranteed to align; use this instead of a `DataList`/CSS-grid "header row" hack, which cannot guarantee alignment (each grid sizes its own `auto` columns independently) |
| Compact labeled-value stat tile (`variant="highlight"` for a large accent-colored headline value) | `StatCard` |
| Uppercase-label section (optionally boxed in a Card) | `PanelSection` |
| Sentence-case heading + content group | `Section` |
| Top-of-tab `<h1>` + intro | `TabHeader` |
| Tab body vertical-stack wrapper | `TabPage` |
| Three-column hero metric card (Live tab only) | `MetricHero` |

**Intentionally not migrated, stay in `components/ui/`:**
- `OverlayFrame.tsx` — frameless overlay window shell. Conceptually Electron-overlay-specific even though it has no literal Electron imports; moving it into the "portable" tree would be a category error.
- `ExternalLink.tsx` — `inline`/`accent` link variants that aren't button-shaped (the `button`/`primaryButton` variants were absorbed into `ButtonLink` back in the Button migration).

**Domain wrappers over primitives:** game-entity inline links use a thin domain wrapper (`components/ItemLink.tsx`) over the presentational `EntityLink` primitive — the wrapper owns grade→color, peek-card choice, and lookup navigation; future entity types (`StageLink`, `MonsterLink`, …) should follow the same split. Do not confuse `EntityLink` (primitive) with `EntityDetail.tsx` (domain detail panel).

**Intentional raw-markup holdouts** (see inline comments at each site): `SortControl` direction toggle (glued button-group seam), `ChestsTrackerPanel` level chips (candidate for a future `ToggleChip` primitive), `LookupHelpTrigger` in `itemCardParts.tsx` (16px info button — too small for `Button`).

## The portability boundary (why, not just what)

`design-system/**` is built to be mechanically extractable into a standalone package if a second (e.g. web) consumer ever exists — it must stay Electron/Node-free. An ESLint rule (`eslint.config.mjs`) enforces this: `no-restricted-imports` blocks `electron`, `node:*`, and anything under `**/main/**`/`**/preload/**` for files under `src/renderer/design-system/**`. Primitives never call `useTbhContext()` or touch `window.tbh` directly — they receive all data through props. If you're tempted to reach for app state inside a primitive, stop: that composition belongs in the consuming tab/component, not the primitive.

## The `cva` variant pattern

Every primitive with visual variants uses `class-variance-authority` via `design-system/lib/variants.ts` (`cn`, `cva`, `VariantProps` — re-exported, not re-implemented). One `cva()` call per file, never hand-rolled `Record<Variant, string>` maps. Worked example, trimmed from `Button/buttonVariants.ts`:

```ts
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "../../lib/variants";

export const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex cursor-pointer items-center justify-center gap-1.5 rounded-md border",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-card border-border text-fg hover:border-accent",
        primary: "bg-accent border-accent text-accent-fg font-semibold",
      },
      size: { default: "px-3.5 py-1.5 text-[13px]", sm: "px-2.5 py-0.5 text-xs" },
    },
    defaultVariants: { variant: "default", size: "default" },
  },
);
export type ButtonVariants = VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants>;
```

If a component file would also export the `cva` object or multiple sub-components alongside its main component, split the extra exports into a sibling file (`buttonVariants.ts`, `TabsParts.tsx`, `DialogParts.tsx`) — co-locating a non-component export with a component breaks Fast Refresh boundary detection (`react-refresh/only-export-components`), and that ESLint rule is enforced project-wide.

## Base UI portals are safe per-window

Each `BrowserWindow` (main, overlay, box tracker) loads the same `index.html` but gets its own separate `document`, so Base UI's default `document.body` portal target is safe per-window — confirmed empirically in this migration's Phase 0 spike. That said, **no Base UI portal component (`Popover`, `Select`, `Dialog`, `Tooltip`) is used inside `Overlay.tsx`/`OverlayFrame.tsx` or `BoxTracker.tsx`** — both are frameless, small (`OverlayFrame`-wrapped) windows where a portal escaping bounds would be visually obvious and bad, so they only ever use non-portal primitives (`Button`, `Switch`) or `Button`'s `nativeTitle` escape hatch (below).

Some Base UI components don't wire ARIA the way you'd expect from their name — verify against the installed package's `.d.ts` files (`node_modules/@base-ui/react/<component>/`) rather than assuming. Example: `Popover.Popup` gets `role="dialog"` automatically; `Tooltip.Popup` does **not** get `role="tooltip"`/`aria-describedby` automatically in the pinned version — `Tooltip.tsx` wires both manually via `useId()`.

## Always use `Tooltip`, never a native `title` attribute

`Tooltip` (`primitives/Tooltip/`) is the only sanctioned way to show hover/focus help text — never add a raw `title="..."` to a DOM element. Native `title` has an inconsistent OS-controlled delay, isn't reliably reachable by keyboard, and isn't visually styled. `Button`, `StatCard`, `Field`, `Select`, and `MultiSelect` all accept a `title` prop and wrap it in a `Tooltip` internally (falling back `aria-label` to it for icon-only buttons), so most call sites don't need to think about this — just keep passing `title`.

For a raw DOM element with supplementary tooltip text (no existing primitive), wrap it directly: `<Tooltip trigger={<span tabIndex={0}>...</span>}>{tipText}</Tooltip>`. Add `tabIndex={0}` so keyboard users can reach it, unless the trigger already wraps a focusable control (an `<input>`/`<button>` inside it) — focus bubbles to the wrapping trigger in that case, so no extra `tabIndex` is needed (see `Field`'s `<label>` wrapping its child input).

**Exception:** `Overlay.tsx`/`OverlayFrame.tsx` and `BoxTracker.tsx` cannot use `Tooltip` (portal constraint above). Pass `Button`'s `nativeTitle` prop there to keep a plain `title` attribute instead — don't reach for a raw `<button title=...>` outside of `Button`. `Section`/`Accordion`/`TabHeader`/`StatGroup`/`PanelSection`/`CacheActionRow`-style `title` props that render as a heading (not a hover tooltip) are unrelated to this rule and stay as-is.

## Layout-stability footer-slot pattern

Conditional UI (reset links, hints, errors) must not shift surrounding layout when it appears or disappears. `Select` and `NumberField` both reserve a fixed `min-h-[1.125rem]` footer slot that always renders — even when `footer` is `undefined` — so the slot's presence is independent of its content. This is enforced by a Testing Library assertion in each component's `.test.tsx` (footer container renders regardless of whether `footer` is passed), not just a convention to remember. Follow this pattern for any new primitive with optional trailing content; see `docs/STYLING.md`'s **Layout stability** section for the broader app-wide rule this primitive-level pattern implements.

## Adding a new primitive

```
design-system/primitives/<Name>/
  <Name>.tsx           # the component (single named export — see Fast Refresh note above)
  <Name>.stories.tsx   # one named export per realistic variant/state, written for an agent learning usage
  <Name>.test.tsx       # Testing Library behavior + jest-axe smoke test
```

- Presentational-only → plain Tailwind + `cva`, no Base UI.
- Needs accessible interactive behavior (focus trap, keyboard nav, portal positioning) → wrap the relevant `@base-ui/react` component (pinned exact version in `app/package.json` — verify before assuming an API from memory or docs, since Base UI is new to this codebase and minor versions can change wiring details, as the Tooltip ARIA example above shows).
- Run `npm run test:dom` (jsdom + Testing Library + `jest-axe`) and `npm run storybook` to verify before considering it done; both are part of the [../QA.md](../QA.md) `pnpm qa` gate.
